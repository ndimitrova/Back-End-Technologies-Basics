Car Management System:
My task was to write a single function that performs various data manipulation operations on a given array of car objects in a car dealership.
1. Filter cars by brand; 2. Add a new car; 3. Find car by ID; 4. Remove car by ID; 5. Update car price; 6. Update car stock status

Books:

My task was using Mocha and Chai to write JS Unit Tests to test a variable named bookService, which represents an object.
1. getBooks(); 2. addBook(book); 3. deleteBook(bookID); 4. updateBook(oldId, newBook).
